Portfolio containing class work for CS4395, Human Language Technologies (NLP).

### [Overview of NLP](https://github.com/sba190007/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/33dbf8d2c17d6b8cbd3a62a044ea75d2353614e0/Overview_of_NLP.pdf) 


### Assignment 1: Text Processing With Python
In this assignment, Python was used to reformat an obselete file of employee records. The data file was parsed and converted to a standardized format, pickled, then unpickled to print. It was a good overview of Python's basic text processing capabilities, as well as object oriented programming in Python.

### Assignment 2: Exploring NLTK
This assignment served as a helpful introduction to how powerful the Natural Toolkit (NLTK) can be for analyzing documents. In the assignment, text samples are analyzed via NLTK's Text class methods, such as lemmatize, stem, and concordance. It gave me a good idea of why Python is so effective at text processing and how NLTK enhances its capabilities even more.

### Assignment 3: Guessing Game
This assignment allowed me to practice several different capabilities
of NLTK, including tokening, parts of speech tagging, and lemmatizing.
It was also good practice into writing a user-interactive program. 

A large text is taken in a sysarg, then the text is preprocessed to
extract the most common nouns. Those nouns are used to implement a game similar to hangman, where the user guesses one of the words
one letter at a time and receives feedback. They can keep playing until they get negative ppints (too many wrong guesses) or input an
exclamation point.
