Portfolio containing class work for CS4395, Human Language Technologies (NLP).

### [Overview of NLP](https://github.com/sba190007/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/33dbf8d2c17d6b8cbd3a62a044ea75d2353614e0/Overview_of_NLP.pdf) 


### Assignment 1: Text Processing With Python
In this assignment, Python was used to reformat an obselete file of employee records. The data file was parsed and converted to a standardized format, pickled, then unpickled to print. It was a good overview of Python's basic text processing capabilities, as well as object oriented programming in Python.

### Assignment 2: Exploring NLTK
This assignment served as a helpful introduction to how powerful the Natural Toolkit (NLTK) can be for analyzing documents. In the assignment, text samples are analyzed via NLTK's Text class methods, such as lemmatize, stem, and concordance. It gave me a good idea of why Python is so effective at text processing and how NLTK enhances its capabilities even more.
